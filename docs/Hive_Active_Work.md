# Hive — Active Work

Status: **IN PROGRESS**

## Phase 1.18A Slice 5 — Host Composition, Settings UI & First-Run Default

Authorized by explicit implementation instruction:

`Hive: Start Phase 1.18A Slice 5`

Repository checkpoint at activation: `ae02f2de479e709a8e5df1af045c9b40768592cc`.

### Authorized scope

Implement only the Phase 1.18A Slice 5 boundary:

- wire the authoritative `HivePersistenceConfiguration` into the real host/application persistence composition for both SQL Server and Embedded backends;
- preserve safe candidate-graph replacement so a failed candidate does not displace the published graph;
- complete the existing Persistence Settings page with `Database Setup` and `Data Migration` tabs;
- expose the `Embedded | SQL Server` backend selector and backend-appropriate configuration/status/lifecycle controls;
- keep persistence configuration, readiness/testing, initialization, and full-data migration behind Hive.Management public boundaries;
- preserve the existing SQL Server configuration path and developer/test LocalDB default;
- implement the intended normal end-user first-run Embedded default;
- update the real Example Host Settings flow as required to demonstrate the Slice 5 surface without creating a competing configuration/persistence graph;
- add/update bounded automated coverage for the Slice 5 contracts and host/UI behavior required by the changed implementation.

### Explicit exclusions

- no Phase 1.18A Slice 6 cross-backend hardening/closure;
- no 1.19 vector storage/indexing/search work;
- no new persistence backend;
- no live synchronization, merge migration, partial resource-family migration, or destructive overwrite;
- no unrelated refactoring or unrelated roadmap advancement.

### Verification boundary

Slice 5 stops at its own verification gate:

- real host composition supports both persistence backends without bypassing Hive.Management;
- a failed candidate composition leaves the currently published graph intact;
- backend selection/configuration does not perform implicit data migration;
- migration remains an explicit operation and does not silently activate the destination;
- normal end-user first-run behavior selects Embedded;
- developer/test LocalDB remains SQL Server-based;
- required automated tests/builds are developer-run and recorded from actual results;
- required Example Host manual verification is recorded only when actually performed.

Current state: **IMPLEMENTATION IN PROGRESS**. No Slice 5 verification result is claimed yet.
