# Hive — Active Work

Status: IN PROGRESS

Authorized task: **Phase 1.16 Follow-Up — Complete Provider Model Metadata Discovery**

Authorized scope:
- extend the established Provider / ProviderAccount / endpoint discovery boundary with a complete normalized provider-reported model profile, including modalities, capabilities, reasoning/thinking information, model-scoped limits, pricing/economic evidence, operational observation metadata, and bounded provider-specific evidence;
- expose the rich discovery through the Advanced Configuration tree with **Overview** and **Model Information** leaves alongside the existing Providers, Accounts / Credentials, and Execution Targets administration pages;
- add structured known-capability configuration using Supported / Unsupported / Unknown states while preserving configured override authority and automatic-target discovery ownership;
- distinguish built-in provider credential requirements as **No credential**, **Optional credential**, or **Required credential**, with optional credentials remaining Secret Store backed;
- add deterministic automated coverage and a matching Example Host scenario for the new public/observable behavior.

Explicit exclusions:
- no durable Model resource;
- no second provider transport implementation for OpenAI-compatible vendors;
- no periodic/background model discovery;
- no automatic probing of every model;
- no duplication of rich discovery metadata into durable ExecutionTarget configuration;
- no Agent-selection or Workspace redesign;
- no unrelated provider/settings refactor.

Verification boundary:
- implementation remains **VERIFICATION PENDING** until developer verification is supplied;
- required handoff at verification: `Example to run: Providers / Target Selection / Capability Discovery / Provider / Model Information — Hive.Example.WinForms`;
- required test handoff: focused Phase 1.16 discovery/model-information tests plus the broader-suite result supplied by the developer.

Do not start later roadmap work or broaden this slice without an explicit new authorization.
